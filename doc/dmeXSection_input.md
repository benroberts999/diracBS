# Input options for: dmeXSection

 * Calculates the cross-section and event rates for ionisation of atoms
 by scattering of DM particle.
 * Takes in the output of "atomicKernal" (see ampsci_input for details)
 * Also calculates "observable" event rates, accounting for detector thresholds
 and resolutions. For now, just for DAMA detector. Will add for XENON
 * For definitions/details, see:
