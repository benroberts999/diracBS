# Input options for: wigner

 * Small routine to calculate 3,6,9-j symbols, and Clebsch Gordan coefficients
 * Either give input via command line directly (quote marks required)
   * e.g., _./wigner '<0.5 -0.5, 0.5 0.5| 1 0>'_
   * or e.g., _./wigner '(0.5 1 0.5, -0.5 0 0.5)'_ etc.
 * Or, give an input file, that contains any number of symbols, all on new line
   * e.g., _./wigner -f myInputFile.in_
   * nb: the '-f' flag can be dropped in the '.in' file extension is used
   * Do not use quote marks in input file. Lines marked '!' or '#' are comments
 * 3j symbols must start with '('; 6,9j with '{', and CG with '<' (this is how code knows which symbol to calculate).
   * but, each number can be separated by any symbol (space, comma etc.)
 * see _'doc/examples/wigner.in'_ for an example input file
